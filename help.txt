give me a step by step guide on how to develop am interactive map that visualize accident hotspots based on sample data. Where Foluim or Plotly Dash is used for the creation of the interactive heatmap of accident locations, load sample accident data(csv with latitude, longitude, severity), allow users to filter accidents by the severity(minor,major,fatal), and display accident details when clicking a map marker. basically the user selects "fatal accidents" then the map highlights only fatal accident locations, and clicking a marker shows accident details(date,time,vehicle involved). the Map could be only windhoek, Namibia
